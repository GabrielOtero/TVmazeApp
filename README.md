## Stack
### Kotlin
All features were developed using Kotlin with Jetpack Android components like LyfeCycle, LiveData, ViewModel and Coroutines.

### Dependency Injection
[Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) was the choosen as DI framework

"*A pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers.*"

### Unit Tests
There are unit tests for almost everything

[MockK](https://mockk.io/) allows creating and stubing objects within test code. Mocking objects allows testing in isolation other objects



### MVVM Architecture

### Clean Architecture

The chosen approach was CA layers in a single module

Its simplest approach that have 3 packages (presentation, domain, data) inside the app module

There are others way to implement Clean Architecture like one CA layer per module or CA layers inside the feature module or even CA layers per feature modules, but since its a very simple app an approach like this is enought
